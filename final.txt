Playbook - Keep all your modules in a single file with YAML syntax.

A Terraform module is a collection of standard configuration files in a dedicated directory. 

A Kubernetes manifest file is a YAML or JSON file that describes the desired state of a Kubernetes object in a cluster.


Pipeline Syntax

Pipeline{
	agent{
		label 'java-agent'
	}
	options{
		timeout(time:30, unit: 'MINUTES')
	}
	Environment{
		Greeting = 'Hello World'
	}
	stages{
		stage('Build'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'
			}
		
		}
		post{
		 always{
		 }
		 success{
		 }
		 failure{
		 }
	}
}

kind: Pod

-----------------------

Using Jenkins and its shared libraries you have ensured that your application code is bug-free and secure too.
Later on you build the image and push the image to a private ECR using Docker.
Then using terraform you have created the necessary infrastructure such as a VPC, SGs, EKS, ALB, RDS, ACM, 
Workstation etc for your application deployment.
At last you have deployed the application to the EKS cluster.
Hope this gives you a better understanding of how to integrate all the tools together.

Devops pipeline stages... PCBTRMO

Deployment Automation
---------------------------
Here are all the tools commonly used in DevOps across various industries:

1)Cloud Computing: AWS ☁️
2)Version Control: Git 📁
3)Pipelines: Jenkins 🚀
4)Configuration Management: Ansible 🔩
5)Containerization: Docker 🐳
6)Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8S) ☸️
7)Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus 📊
8)Infrastructure as Code: Terraform 🌐

These tools help streamline the DevOps process, making software development, deployment, and 
management more efficient and effective.
-------------
Prometheus

Cloud Environment: Prometheus should find the nodes automatically and add them to scrape list

Service Discovery:
---------------------
 Underlying nodes should have node exporter installed and started

Describe ec2 instances ---> listing ec2 instances---> get the IP address

filter using tags, Monitoring -- true 

if value < 1, then raise the alert

1. raise the alert
2. manage the alert
