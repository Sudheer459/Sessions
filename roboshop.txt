22nd July Session 70

Roboshop
----------------
MongoDB --> NoSQL
MySQL --> tables and rows
NoSQL --> collections and documents

Product information --> product catalogue

Redis --> cache

backend --> MySQL
1. Get the connection from MySQL
2. Run the DB query --> this should be efficient
3. Get the results
4. Close the connection


backend --> MySQL --> Cache

backend --> Cache --> MySQL --> Cache

key -> value

MySQL --> RDS DB, Countries, cities, pincodes, etc.

RabbitMQ --> Messaging Queue
----------------------------
HTTP --> you will hit some website,
HTTP can wait for 30sec or 1min, if no response it will throw error.

Synchronus communication
--------------
1. both systems should be up and running
2. if 2nd system is down you loose the transaction

Whatsapp
----------------
Ramesh --> Suresh

Message will be sent to suresh immediately

If suresh is offline, 

Async
------
1. Systems no need to be online continously.
2. Messages are waiting in queue
3. Once system is online messages would be delivered, so no data loss.	
4. Systems are loosely coupled

Flipkart --> ekart

Flipkart will send the order details to one queue --> ekart would be listening to the queue

Queue --> point to point = One system sends messages only one system can get the message

topic and subscribe --> Like youtube notifications

When I upload a video, youtube have a topic to my channel. All subscriber device are subscribed to that channel,
then everyone will get the message

Application tier
------------------
catalogue --> an application maintaining the product catalogue
cart --> adding products to cart, connecting to redis and mongodb
user --> user info like name,email, username and password. details are in nosql and cached
shipping --> countries and cities info is processed through shippping, data is in mysql
payments --> collecting the payments, rabbitmq
dispatch --> based on again MQ, roboshop send a message to the queue, dispatch will receive the message
ratings --> product ratings stored in mysql


Web tier
-------------------
Nginx based static application and reverse proxy to application tier.



MongoDB
----------
port = 27017
127.0.0.1 == localhost
0.0.0.0/0

Java
------
Java source code -- compile -- bytecode == development environment = jdk

We run bytcode in jre environment

jre is subset of jdk

jdk mremory is morethan jre

.zip -- zipping the sources files(.js files) with node_modules(dependencies), npm(node package manager) package.json

.jar -- java Archive file

maven is here built tool
----------------------
pom.xml -- build file

mvn package -- mvn compile, mvn test, mvn package

.jar = bytecode + dependencies

mvn package -- target directory -- our app.jar file is inside the target directory.

mvn == java+Maven

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'expense'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ExpenseApp@1';
GRANT ALL ON transactions.* TO 'expense'@'%';

python
-------------
pip -- build tool
requirements.txt -- dependencies
