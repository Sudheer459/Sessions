Playbook - Keep all your modules in a single file with YAML syntax.

A Terraform module is a collection of standard configuration files in a dedicated directory. 

A Kubernetes manifest file is a YAML or JSON file that describes the desired state of a Kubernetes object in a cluster.


Pipeline Syntax

Pipeline{
	agent{
		label 'java-agent'

	options{
		timeout(time:30, unit: 'MINUTES')
	}
	Environment{
		Greeting = 'Hello World'
	}
	stages{
		stage('Build'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'

-----------------------

Using Jenkins and its shared libraries you have ensured that your application code is bug-free and secure too.
Later on you build the image and push the image to a private ECR using Docker.
Then using terraform you have created the necessary infrastructure such as a VPC, SGs, EKS, ALB, RDS, ACM, 
Workstation etc for your application deployment.
At last you have deployed the application to the EKS cluster.
Hope this gives you a better understanding of how to integrate all the tools together.
